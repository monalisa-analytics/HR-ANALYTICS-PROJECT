## 1. Introduction
Human Resource Analytics plays a vital role in understanding employee behavior, improving retention, and optimizing workforce performance. Organizations face challenges such as employee attrition, productivity gaps, and engagement issues.

This project focuses on analysing employee data to uncover insights related to attrition, employee demographics, performance, satisfaction, and attendance patterns using Python in Google Colaboratory.

The objective is to build a data-driven approach to support HR decision-making.

## 2. Objectives of the Project
- Analyze employee attrition trends  
- Identify key factors influencing employee turnover  
- Understand workforce distribution by age, gender, and department  
- Evaluate employee performance, satisfaction, and engagement  
- Provide actionable insights for HR strategy improvement

## 3. Dataset Description
The dataset contains **311 employee records** and **37 features**, including:

| Category | Example Columns |
|-------|----------------|
| Employee Info | Employee_Name, EmpID, GenderID, DOB |
| Job Details | Department, Position, ManagerName |
| Performance | PerformanceScore, EngagementSurvey |
| Attendance | Absences, DaysLateLast30 |
| Employment Status | EmploymentStatus, TermReason |
| Compensation | Salary |
| Demographics | Sex, RaceDesc, CitizenDesc |

---

## 4. Data Cleaning & Preparation
Performed in Google Colaboratory using Python:
- Imported CSV file using Pandas  
- Checked missing values and data types  
- Created a new column **Attrition**  
  - Active = 0  
  - Terminated / Resigned = 1  
- Converted DOB into Age  
- Created Age Groups:
  - 18–25  
  - 26–35  
  - 36–45  
  - 46–55  
  - 56–65

## 5. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| KPI | Description |
|----|------------|
| Total Employees | Total number of employees |
| Attrition Count | Number of employees who left |
| Attrition Rate (%) | Attrition Count / Total Employees |
| Average Salary | Mean salary of employees |
| Average Engagement Score | Employee engagement level |
| Average Satisfaction | Employee satisfaction rating |
| Average Absences | Average number of absences |

These KPIs help assess workforce health and organizational stability.

## 6. Data Visualization & Analysis
Visuals created in Google Colaboratory:
- **Attrition by Department** – Identifies departments with higher employee turnover  
- **Gender Distribution** – Shows workforce diversity balance  
- **Age Group Distribution** – Highlights dominant age groups  
- **Salary vs Performance Score** – Evaluates performance impact on compensation  
- **Absence Impact on Attrition** – Analyzes relationship between absences and employee exit  

---

## 7. Key Insights
- Certain departments experience higher attrition, indicating potential workload or management issues  
- Majority of employees belong to the **36–45 age group**  
- Employees with lower satisfaction scores show higher probability of attrition  
- Higher absence rates correlate with employee turnover  
- Performance ratings impact salary distribution  
- Balanced gender distribution reflects workforce diversity
